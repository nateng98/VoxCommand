# VoxCommand
**VoxCommand** is a voice-controlled python script that enables users to effortlessly trigger specific key commands or combinations through intuitive voice commands.

### Backstory
When my right thumb was sidelined by a fracture, I found myself unable to execute the mouse key 4 *(switching weapons)* and  mouse key 5 *(auto attacking)*, which were essential for playing my favorite MMORPG, Guild Wars 2. Frustrated by this limitation, I set out to develop **VoxCommand** â€” a voice-controlled solution that allowed me to seamlessly trigger those commands without relying on my injured thumb. What began as a personal quest for accessibility in gaming turned into VoxCommand, a tool that empowers users facing similar "challenges" to press a certain button or combination of buttons using simple voice commands.
